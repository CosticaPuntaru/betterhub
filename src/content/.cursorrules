# Content Script Zone Rules

## Purpose
Content scripts that modify GitHub UI - dynamically loaded based on enabled features.

## Key Files
- `github.ts` - Main orchestrator that loads enabled features

## Patterns
- Features are loaded dynamically via `import()` based on settings
- Use MutationObserver for dynamically loaded GitHub content
- Subscribe to settings changes for real-time updates
- Check `window.location.pathname` to determine which page you're on

## Common Tasks
- Load feature modules conditionally
- Apply/remove UI modifications based on settings
- Handle GitHub's dynamic content loading

## What NOT to Do
- Don't modify GitHub's core functionality (only UI)
- Don't block GitHub's scripts
- Don't use inline styles if avoidable (use CSS classes)

- See `src/shared/utils/settings-manager.ts` for settings access
- See feature `content.ts` files for examples
