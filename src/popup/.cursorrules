# Popup Zone Rules

## Purpose
Extension popup UI - quick access shell that can load feature components.

## Key Files
- `popup.html` - Popup HTML structure
- `popup.ts` - Popup logic
- `popup.css` - Popup styles

## Patterns
- Keep popup simple - link to options page for full settings
- Load feature popup components conditionally if needed
- Use i18n for all strings
- Initialize settings manager on load

## Common Tasks
- Display quick status/links
- Load feature-specific popup components
- Handle popup-specific interactions

## What NOT to Do
- Don't put all settings in popup (use options page)
- Don't make popup too complex
- Don't forget to handle popup close/reopen
