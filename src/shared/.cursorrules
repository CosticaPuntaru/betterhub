# Shared Zone Rules

## Purpose
Shared utilities, types, and constants used across the extension.

## Key Directories
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `constants/` - Constants and feature registry
- `locales/` - Translation files

## Key Files
- `utils/settings-manager.ts` - Centralized settings management
- `utils/feature-registry.ts` - Feature registration system
- `utils/i18n.ts` - Internationalization utilities
- `utils/settings-renderer.ts` - Settings UI rendering
- `types/settings.ts` - Settings type definitions
- `types/settings-ui.ts` - Settings UI schema types

## Patterns
- All settings go through `settingsManager`
- Features register via `featureRegistry`
- Use i18next for translations
- Settings schemas define UI declaratively

## Common Tasks
- Add new setting types to `types/settings.ts`
- Use `settingsManager.subscribe()` for real-time updates
- Register features with `featureRegistry.register()`

## What NOT to Do
- Don't access chrome.storage directly - use `settingsManager`
- Don't duplicate utility functions
- Don't forget to type everything
