# BetterHub Project Rules

## Project Overview
BetterHub is a cross-browser Chrome extension for GitHub customization with a feature-based architecture.

## Key Conventions
- Use strict TypeScript with no implicit any
- All features are self-contained in `src/features/feature-name/`
- Settings are managed centrally via `src/shared/utils/settings-manager.ts`
- Use i18next for translations - write English strings directly in code
- Features export settings schemas for automatic UI generation
- Real-time settings sync across all contexts

## File Structure
- `src/features/` - Feature modules (self-contained)
- `src/shared/` - Shared utilities, types, constants
- `src/background/` - Service worker
- `src/content/` - Content scripts
- `src/popup/` - Extension popup
- `src/options/` - Settings page

## Adding a New Feature
1. Create directory `src/features/feature-name/`
2. Create `index.ts` with feature registration and settings schema
3. Create `content.ts` for GitHub UI modifications
4. Add feature settings to `src/shared/types/settings.ts`
5. Feature will auto-register and appear in options page
